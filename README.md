### - SETUP.py
- Setup.py is an imporant feature  of __hackv1__ , Hackv1 is a little manual , but requires less dependencies !

>-   #### Work of Setup.py
 - It scarapes Out all 18-19 digit numbers from text of  ```/scan```
 - Spam ```/scan``` multiple times and Copy All the Result and Put it in ```text_Scrape.txt``` 
 - It Will put all the scraped text in assets/hacks.txt file


### - HACKv1.py
>   The first Model of Automator

- After Setting up All the ids /code in Hacks.txt , It will read the code and execute ```/hack {id}```

 ####  Auto Upgrade feature
If you gain alot of BTC , then others will simply take it from you if you leave it like that all along, To prevent it There is a must need of upgrade 

- do a __*```/exploit```*__ or __*```/virus```*__ , then press __Shift__ , It will simply Record the Mouse Position , and randomly upgrade your exploits , firewall and Virus





>[!NOTE] 
>    __It is seen as after some time , the hackv1 continues working but the HackYou Bot Breaks (you will see Negative Time Errors) . This happens due to late use of Codes and old codes__
